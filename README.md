# Alien-Invasion
Made with Pygame, early tries at making the ship move and shoot.
What I want the final result to be:
"""
In Alien invasion, the player controls a spaceship that displays on the lower part of the screen center.
The player can move the spaceship right and left using the direction keys and shoot using the spacebar.
When the game starts, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves down and to the sides. The players shoots
the aliens and destroys them. If the players hits every alien, a new fleet, that moves faster than the latter 
one, will show up. If any alien hits the spaceship belonging  to the player ou reaches the lowest part of the
screen, the players looses a ship. If the player gets all his 3 ships destroyed the game will end."""
